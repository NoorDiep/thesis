MSc scriptie VLK

The seven models included in the thesis are: AR, ARX, PCA-AR, PCA-ARX, AE-AR, AE-ARX and LSTM.
They are all retrieved within three python files:
  - AR, ARX: AR_ARX.py
  - PCA-AR, PCA-ARX: PCA.py
  - AE-AR, AE-ARX: autoencoder.py
  - LSTM: NNARX.py
  
Next to these python scripts, Drivers.py also needs to be imported. 
The yml file provides the environment for the pyhton project.
  
Finally, the data for the thesis consits of:
   - SwapDriverData1.xlsx
   - Driver.xlsx
   - Spread.xlsx
  Make sure to include these in your python project folder
